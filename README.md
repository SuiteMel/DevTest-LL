## This is a coding challenge that I am working on.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* [Slick Carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

### Challenges

This challenge required the use of no CSS Frameworks. Ever since I was introduced to CSS Frameworks, I have used them in lieu of more traditional CSS techniques. The challenges that I faced because of this quickly became prominent. But, due to not using a CSS Framework, I have learned about new techniques such as the use of flex box in order to display elements in a less volatile manner. I've also learned some new techniques in regards to sizing images dynamically and the use of animations.

### To Do's

The navigation bar gave me the most problems after some time, getting the elements to go across the page the way I wanted them to, was proving to be a challenge, that I had to stop focusing on, so that I could succeed at other challenges.

The contact section is proving difficult. The form elements are not sizing properly, and keep overflowing outside of the parent element. This is proving difficult to maintain consistency. I'm also not sure if I should make the picture disappear in a smaller viewport.

The footer did not cause me many problems, but I do need to make it responsive. And I'm sure I'll run into some issues while doing that.

### Thoughts

This was a good challenge for me, I learned a lot. I have a lot to learn. I need to take the time to learn and make use of more CSS techniques instead of using CSS Frameworks right off the bat. Working on this has been a great opportunity to learn from.
